Put.io OAuth API Wrapper written in PHP
=======================================
**(OAuth/API Version 2)**

A simple, but powerful PHP class for [put.io](https://put.io/)'s [OAuth API](https://api.put.io/v2/docs/) (version 2).
Supports all features that put.io's API provides, including file uploads, downloads, transfers, friends, etc...

Requires PHP 5.3, and the following PHP extensions: [cURL](http://php.net/book.curl) and [JSON](http://php.net/book.json).

Take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/nicoSWD/put.io-API-v2-Wrapper/wiki/) and [put.io's API documentation](https://api.put.io/v2/docs/) to get started.

**Pull requests are welcome!**
